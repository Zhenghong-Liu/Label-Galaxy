Enables all available rules,\n *   but still without html, typographer & autolinker.\n * - [\"zero\"](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/blob/master/lib/presets/zero.mjs) -\n *   all rules disabled. Useful to quickly setup your config via `.enable()`.\n *   For example, when you need only `bold` and `italic` markup and nothing else.\n *\n * ##### options:\n *\n * - __html__ - `false`. Set `true` to enable HTML tags in source. Be careful!\n *   That's not safe! You may need external sanitizer to protect output from XSS.\n *   It's better to extend features via plugins, instead of enabling HTML.\n * - __xhtmlOut__ - `false`. Set `true` to add '/' when closing single tags\n *   (`<br />`). This is needed only for full CommonMark compatibility. In real\n *   world you will need HTML output.\n * - __breaks__ - `false`. Set `true` to convert `\\n` in paragraphs into `<br>`.\n * - __langPrefix__ - `language-`. CSS language class prefix for fenced blocks.\n *   Can be useful for external highlighters.\n * - __linkify__ - `false`. Set `true` to autoconvert URL-like text to links.\n * - __typographer__  - `false`. Set `true` to enable [some language-neutral\n *   replacement](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/blob/master/lib/rules_core/replacements.mjs) +\n *   quotes beautification (smartquotes).\n * - __quotes__ - `“”‘’`, String or Array. Double + single quotes replacement\n *   pairs, when typographer enabled and smartquotes on. For example, you can\n *   use `'«»„“'` for Russian, `'„“‚‘'` for German, and\n *   `['«\\xA0', '\\xA0»', '‹\\xA0', '\\xA0›']` for French (including nbsp).\n * - __highlight__ - `null`. Highlighter function for fenced code blocks.\n *   Highlighter `function (str, lang)` should return escaped HTML. It can also\n *   return empty string if the source was not changed and should be escaped\n *   externaly. If result starts with <pre... internal wrapper is skipped.\n *\n * ##### Example\n *\n * ```javascript\n * // commonmark mode\n * var md = require('markdown-it')('commonmark');\n *\n * // default mode\n * var md = require('markdown-it')();\n *\n * // enable everything\n * var md = require('markdown-it')({\n *   html: true,\n *   linkify: true,\n *   typographer: true\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * ##### Syntax highlighting\n *\n * ```js\n * var hljs = require('highlight.js') // https://highlightjs.org/\n *\n * var md = require('markdown-it')({\n *   highlight: function (str, lang) {\n *     if (lang && hljs.getLanguage(lang)) {\n *       try {\n *         return hljs.highlight(str, { language: lang, ignoreIllegals: true }).value;\n *       } catch (__) {}\n *     }\n *\n *     return ''; // use external default escaping\n *   }\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * Or with full wrapper override (if you need assign class to `<pre>` or `<code>`):\n *\n * ```javascript\n * var hljs = require('highlight.js') // https://highlightjs.org/\n *\n * // Actual default values\n * var md = require('markdown-it')({\n *   highlight: function (str, lang) {\n *     if (lang && hljs.getLanguage(lang)) {\n *       try {\n *         return '<pre><code class=\"hljs\">' +\n *                hljs.highlight(str, { language: lang, ignoreIllegals: true }).value +\n *                '</code></pre>';\n *       } catch (__) {}\n *     }\n *\n *     return '<pre><code class=\"hljs\">' + md.utils.escapeHtml(str) + '</code></pre>';\n *   }\n * });\n * ```\n *\n **/\nfunction MarkdownIt (presetName, options) {\n  if (!(this instanceof MarkdownIt)) {\n    return new MarkdownIt(presetName, options)\n  }\n\n  if (!options) {\n    if (!utils.isString(presetName)) {\n      options = presetName || {}\n      presetName = 'default'\n    }\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * MarkdownIt#inline -> ParserInline\n   *\n   * Instance of [[ParserInline]].

\"要使用`astroquery`的`Vizier`服务来检索`I/345/gaia2`星表中M3（三角座星系团）附近3角分范围内，亮于19等的天体，你需要遵循以下步骤：\\n\\n首先，你需要安装`astroquery`（如果还没有安装的话）：\\n\\n```bash\\npip install astroquery\\n```\\n\\n然后，你可以使用以下Python脚本来完成检索：\\n\\n```python\\nfrom astropy import units as u\\nfrom astropy.coordinates import SkyCoord\\nfrom astroquery.vizier import Vizier\\n\\n# M3的中心坐标（这里使用示例坐标，你可能需要查找准确的坐标）\\nm3_center = SkyCoord(ra=15.8088*u.degree, dec=+34.0222*u.degree, frame='icrs')\\n\\n# 搜索半径为3角分\\nsearch_radius = 0.05 * u.degree  # 3角分转换为度\\n\\n# Vizier查询参数\\nvizier = Vizier(catalog=\\\"I/345/gaia2\\\")\\n\\n# 设置查询条件：位置、亮度等\\nvizier.ROW_LIMIT = -1  # 取消返回的行数限制（如果有的话）\\nquery_conditions = {\\n    'Vmag': '<19',  # 亮度小于19等\\n    'Pos': m3_center.to_string('hmsdms'),  # 转换为hmsdms格式用于查询\\n    'SR': search_radius.to(u.arcmin).value  # 搜索半径转换为角分\\n}\\n\\n# 执行查询\\nresult_table = vizier.query_region(m3_center, radius=search_radius, **query_conditions)\\n\\n# 打印结果\\nprint(result_table)\\n\\n# 如果你想要将结果保存到文件，可以使用astropy的Table的write方法\\n# result_table.write('m3_gaia2_results.csv', format='csv')\\n```\\n\\n**注意**：\\n\\n1. 我假设了M3的中心坐标，但在实际应用中，你应该查找并使用正确的坐标。\\n2. `Vizier`的`query_region`方法可能不支持直接传递亮度限制作为参数，因此我们在`query_conditions`字典中设置了`Vmag`条件。不过，这取决于`I/345/gaia2`星表是否支持在Vizier查询中直接设置这样的条件。如果不支持，你可能需要在下载数据后，在本地对数据进行筛选。\\n3. 我设置了`vizier.ROW_LIMIT = -1`来取消返回的行数限制，但并非所有Vizier服务都支持这个参数。如果不支持，你可能需要处理分页返回的结果。\\n4. `SR`参数通常接受角分的值，但具体取决于Vizier服务的实现。如果它不接受角分，你可能需要将其转换为度。\\n5. 请确保你的网络连接稳定，因为查询可能会花费一些时间，特别是当没有设置行限制且结果集很大时。\",\r\n\t\t\t\tloading:
